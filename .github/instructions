Project: VCC-UDS3 (Universal Data System 3)
Language: Python

Purpose:
- Central data management, ingestion and API layer for the VCC ecosystem.

What Copilot should help with:
- Build reliable ingestion pipelines, schema validation and ETL tasks.
- Suggest idempotent data processing steps and schema versioning.

Coding style and constraints:
- Keep ETL steps modular and testable. Do not store raw ingestion dumps in repo.

Documentation duties (./docs):
- Document data contracts, ingestion formats, and retention policies in `docs/`.

Todo.md continuation:
- Add clear tasks for data-source onboarding and transformation pipelines.

Examples for Copilot prompts:
- "Create an ingestion pipeline that reads CSV, normalizes fields and stores into PostgreSQL with transaction safety."

Testing & CI:
- Include sample fixtures and integration tests that run pipeline on a small dataset.
